# Consulta

This is my second project as developer. 

About this project

This project is a psychologist agenda, to unified your clients and take a control fo your appointments. Taking advantage of my previous experiencie, I created a calendar view to make it easy to manage your appointments. 

Beside that, there's also a landing page where you find out more about the webiste, and take in contact with administration. 

The project is ready to manage several psychologists and different clients.
